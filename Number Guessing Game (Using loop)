// Write a program that generates a random number and asks the player to guess it. If the player's guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays 'Lower number please'. Similarly if the user's guess is to low, the program prints 'Higher number please'. When the user guesses the corrrect number, the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.  

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<time.h>
int main()
{
    int number, guess, nguesses=1;
    srand(time(0));
    number = rand()%100+1;
    do{
        printf("Guess the number between 1 to 100\n");
        scanf("%d",&guess);
        if (guess>number){
            printf("Lower number please!\n");
        }
        else if (guess<number){
            printf("Higher number please!");
        }
        else{
            printf("You guessed it in %d attempts\n",nguesses);
        }
        nguesses++;
    }while (guess!=number);
    return 0;
}
