/* Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, and prints twice as many lines as the number inputted.

The first half of every other line contains one * character at the start, as many spaces as the number of this line (line numbers count from 0 in this task) and one * character at the end of the line. 
The second half is a mirror reflection of the first.
The outputted "drawing" should be similar to an arrowhead.*/
