/*Write a program that asks the user to enter four numbers as strings, and creates a human readable IP address from them. 
Your main task is to think about an appropriate data size to store the IP address. After this, your program should print the string.
To insert four numbers (and three dots) into a string, you may use the sprintf function (not described), copy all the characters manually, or use another method more suitable for you.*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)

	char IPAddressPart1[4];
	char IPAddressPart2[4];
	char IPAddressPart3[4];
	char IPAddressPart4[4];
	char IPAddress[16];

	scanf("%s", IPAddressPart1);
	scanf("%s", IPAddressPart2);
