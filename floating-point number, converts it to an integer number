/*Write a program that takes one floating-point number, converts it to an integer number, and then prints a description of the given number.
numbers greater than or equal to 1 and less than 2 - Very bad.
numbers greater than or equal to 2 and less than 3 - Bad.
numbers greater than or equal to 3 and less than 4 - Neutral.
numbers greater than or equal to 4 and less than 5 - Good.
numbers greater than or equal to 5 and less than 6 - Very good.

When a number is out of the given range (1<=x<6), the program should print nothing.*/
